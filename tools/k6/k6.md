## K6

K6 is a load testing tool, it's written in Go and uses js runtime.

Install:
```shell
brew install k6
```

Then write a load testing script. See an [example](./script.js).

Run load testing for 10 seconds with 10 virtual users and show given percentiles:
```shell
k6 run --vus 10 --duration 10s --summary-trend-stats='p(99),p(99.9),p(100)' script.js
```

k6 will output stats. http_req_duration is a total latency stats.

There are plugins what can create html reports.

Install plugin
```shell
go install go.k6.io/xk6/cmd/xk6@latest
```

Build the custom binary
```shell
xk6 build --with github.com/szkiba/xk6-dashboard@latest
```

Run the test with the custom binary (note ./k6 instead of k6)
```shell
./k6 run --out dashboard --vus 10 --duration 10s script.js
```

Dashboard is available at http://127.0.0.1:5665. It works pretty bad, but still ...
