## Unreal Engine

### Install
You need to download Epic Games Launcher and download Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) from there.


UE5 is ~15GB download (150GB with debug symbols). You'll also need Xcode.

I tried following the tutorial "Your first hour in Unreal Engine 5": https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/courses/ZpX/your-first-hour-in-unreal-engine-5-0/
It's messed up, because current version is 5.4 and tutorial uses assets from Online Learning Kit that's 
requires version <= 5.1

Right mouse button + WASD moves the viewport in the editor. 
Right mouse button + QE moves the viewport down/up.

Choose "unlit" in the top left corner, that helps to see the scene if have no lighting.
Select an item (in the right column) and press "F" to respectfully focus on the item.
