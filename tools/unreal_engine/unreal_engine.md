## Unreal Engine

### Install
You need to download Epic Games Launcher and download Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) from there.


UE5 is ~15GB download (150GB with debug symbols). You'll also need Xcode.

I followed the tutorial "Your first hour in Unreal Engine 5": https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/courses/ZpX/your-first-hour-in-unreal-engine-5-0/

Right mouse button + WASD moves the viewport in the editor. 
Right mouse button + QE moves the viewport down/up.
