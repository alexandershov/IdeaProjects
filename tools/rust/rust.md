## Rust

Rust is a systems programming language.

It doesn't have GC and relies on explicit concepts of ownership instead.


Create cargo package in a current directory (this will create Cargo.toml & /src dir)
```shell
cargo init
```

Compile & run the project
```shell
cargo run
```

See [main.rs](./src/main.rs) for examples of Rust code.
