## IntelliJ New Features

Most interesting Intellij new features since 2020.1

### Refactoring
You can just change name/signature and then use popup in a gutter or with Opt-Enter
to make a refactoring out of this change.


### Exploring
Opt-Space to show definition of current symbol in a popup.


### Running
You can save your running configurations into file.
Select configuration in "Edit configuration" and enable checkbox "Store as project file"


### Testing
You can drop into debugger on failed tests:
1. Enable "drop into debugger on failed test"
2. Run your tests under debugger
3. Now when tests fail you'll drop into debugger automatically. Cool stuff.
