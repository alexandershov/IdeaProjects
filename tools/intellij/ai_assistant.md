## IDEA AI Assistant

### Chat
There's a chat with AI Assistant.
It's basically the same as ChatGPT.
Using buttons in code snippets you can also insert generated code to IDE at caret or create a new file.


### Inline actions

Opt-Enter -> "AI Actions"
You can:
* Ask AI to explain code
* Suggest refactoring
* Find a problem in a code
* Generate docstring for a function
* Generate tests

For code-writing tasks IDEA will open a window, you can "Specify" new requirements if 
generated code is not very good.

When you refactor with Ctrl-T -> "Rename" (or Shift-F6) AI will suggest names.
Also when you run something and there's an error/traceback in output there's an inline "Explain with AI"

You can also give inline command to AI with Cmd-\ (like "write a binary search") and it will do it in place.

### VSC
You can generate commit message with AI. There's a button in a commit dialog.

You can also select several commits in Cmd-9 window and there's an actions "Explain Commits with AI"

### Logging
You can view what messages were sent to LLM: "Find anywhere" -> "Open AI Assistant Requests Log in Editor".
