## IntelliJ Database Tools

### Data source

Click on the database icon in the top right corner (it's near notifications, AI assistant etc.)

Add a new database, set connection params.

Select a data source, you can edit tables inline,
add new tables, add rows (remember to click on "submit" when you want to, ahem, submit your changes),
or run queries.

You can also show a diagram of your database (right-click on "Tables" and then "Diagram" -> "Show Diagram")
