    "If we do a naive approach of encrypting: just taking some key and encrypting with it each 16 byte chunk, then we'll have some problems:\n",
    "*  Same chunks of 16-bytes will always result in the same result. Attacker can guess some stuff from that.\n",
    "   This can be fixed by using IV (initialization vector): encrypting side generates some random byte sequence. This random sequence is used an initial state of the algorithm. Encrypting side can prepend IV to the encrypted text and decrypting side needs to be aware of that to get IV for decryption.\n",
    "* Even if we're using IV for each 16-byte chunk, then we still can have some problems. Consider image. Each 16-byte chunk of an image will be encrypted to the same result even with initial IV. If you have a bunch of same 16-byte chunks, they will just change color. So you can see some patterns in an image. This can be fixed by using cipher block chaining (CBC), with CBC before encryption each 16-byte chunk is XOR-ed with the previous 16-byte encrypted text. Now each 16-byte chunk depends on all the previous bytes. So there'll be no patterns. Since XOR is reversible if you know XOR result and one of the XOR arguments it all works out. "
